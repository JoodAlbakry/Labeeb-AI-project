Project tilte: Labeeb

Labeeb is an AI-powered application designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard of hearing by translating Saudi Sign Language (SSL) into text in real time. It uses a camera-based system and machine learning models trained to recognize and interpret SSL gestures accurately.

Labeeb promotes inclusivity and accessibility by enabling seamless communication between sign language users and the wider community through advanced technology.
